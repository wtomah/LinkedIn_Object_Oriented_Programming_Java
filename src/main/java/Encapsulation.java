/*
Encapsulation

*Object-oriented programming principle
*Bind state and behavior together into a single unit
*Combine data and code acting on that data

Encapsulation in Java

*Java classes allow us to bind together data and related functionality
*We can implement parts of the encapsulation principle in Java with classes

Benefits of Encapsulation

*Prevent classes from becoming tightly coupled
*Easily modify the inner workings of one class without affecting the rest of the program
*Clear pathways for classes to communicate
*Less code changes required for a refactoring change
*Less likely for an attribute to be overwritten with an invalid or null value expectedly

Encapsulation Requires Restriction

*We need a clear interface between a given class and the rest of the program
*Everything can't have direct access
Implement Encapsulation in Java

*Make a class's attributes hidden from other classes using encapsulation
*Provide a clear interface through public methods

Access Modifier

*Allows you to determine programmatically where certain variables and methods can be accessed in your code

Achieve Encapsulation in Java

*Restrict each attribute with the private access modifier
*Write accessible methods to get and set the values of each attribute with the public access modifier
