/*
*Java supports abstract classes and interfaces
* Easier to contribute to abstract systems
* All you need to know are the inputs, outputs, and a general idea of what the system does
* No need to get bogged down in the details
* abstract class is almost like a template class where some functionality is not implemented yet
* Other classes extend the abstract class and implement the appropriate functionality
